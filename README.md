Description

Create Password Generator to generate random passwords based on user-selected criteria.  A random password generator is one way to create a more secure password because it is fully randomized as opposed to regular user created passwords that may contain a more common combination of words and numbers.  Strong passwords are important for keeping hackers from stealing important information.

Usage

The user will first click on the Generate Password button.  There are then a series of pop-up messages to determine what guidelines are needed for the password to generate.  

The user will select how many characters they want their password to contain being limited by using at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.  If an invalid selection is made, meaning things such as: a number outside that range was typed, a letter or other symbol is typed, or the Cancel button is clicked, the user will have to start over by clicking on the Generate Password button again.  Once a valid entry is made and the OK button is selected a message will verify how many characters were inputted.  

There will then be four (4) prompts asking the user if they want to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.  Clicking OK will include each of the options in the password and clicking Cancel will exclude the specific characters from the final password.  If cancel is clicked on all four (4) character, a message will state that at least one (1) character type must be selected and the pop-ups will again end; the user will have to start at the beginning again.  

At the end when all pop-ups have been answered there will be one final message to click OK for the password generation to happen.  The new password then appears in the text box on the screen.
